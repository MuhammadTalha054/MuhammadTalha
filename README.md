CodeReuse Class Documentation:
Method: sortDescending
Purpose: Sorts an array of integers in descending order.
Arguments:
array: An array of integers to be sorted in descending order.
Return:
No explicit return. The input array gets sorted in place.
Method: calculateStatistics
Purpose: Calculates statistical measures for an array of integers.
Arguments:
array: An array of integers for which statistics need to be calculated.
Return:
An array of doubles containing:
Median at index 0
Variance at index 1
Standard Deviation at index 2
Sum of Squares at index 3
Method: matrixMultiplication
Purpose: Performs matrix multiplication on two 2D integer arrays.
Arguments:
matrixA: First matrix
matrixB: Second matrix
rowsA: Number of rows in matrixA
columnsA: Number of columns in matrixA (also rows in matrixB)
columnsB: Number of columns in matrixB
Return:
The resulting matrix as a 2D array.
